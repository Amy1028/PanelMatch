## Highlighting groups in `DisplayTreatment` function

In some cases, creating "categories" or "groups" for units in a data set might be useful. It would therefore be helpful to have the ability to have such groups reflected visually in the treatment/control plots generated by the `Display Treatment` function. Some basic functionality to do this has been added. The function now accepts an additional argument that allows users to specify a column from which groups will be created. These groups are highlighted on the resulting plot. The order in which units are displayed _within groups_ is consistent with the order specified by the user. By default, this is the "amount of treatment" a unit has received. So, within each group, units are ordered from "least treated" to "most treated" (from bottom to top).

```
# Create a smaller subset of units
subdem <- dem[dem$wbcode2 %in% c(111, 108 , 32, 128, 148), ]
# Placing the units into arbitrary "categories"
subdem$cat <- 0
subdem$cat[subdem$wbcode2 == 111] <- 2
subdem$cat[subdem$wbcode2 == 108] <- 1
DisplayTreatment(unit.id = "wbcode2",
                 time.id = "year", legend.position = "none",
                 xlab = "year", ylab = "Country Code",
                 treatment = "dem", data = subdem, group_on = "cat")
```

This can be compared with:
```
DisplayTreatment(unit.id = "wbcode2",
                 time.id = "year", legend.position = "none",
                 xlab = "year", ylab = "Country Code",
                 treatment = "dem", data = subdem)
```
which generates

## Specifying a display order

As mentioned above, units are displayed from "least treated" to "most treated" by default (from bottom to top). However, the user can specify a different column to order units from the lowest average value of that variable to the highest average value (or from highest to lowest)

First, generate some quantitative "data" for each unit at each point in time and calculate an average value per unit.
```
set.seed(2)
ssd <- subdem
ssd$sort <- runif(n = nrow(ssd))
tapply(ssd$sort, ssd$wbcode2, FUN = mean)
```
which generates
```
      32       108       111       128       148 
0.5012996 0.4749543 0.5099899 0.4802151 0.5113627 
```

```
DisplayTreatment(unit.id = "wbcode2",
                 time.id = "year", legend.position = "none",
                 xlab = "year", ylab = "Country Code",
                 treatment = "dem", data = ssd, sort_by = "sort")
```

DisplayTreatment(unit.id = "wbcode2",
                 time.id = "year", legend.position = "none",
                 xlab = "year", ylab = "Country Code",
                 treatment = "dem", data = ssd, sort_by = "sort", decreasing = TRUE)
```
