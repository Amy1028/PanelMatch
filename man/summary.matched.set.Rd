\title{Summarize information about a \code{matched.set} object and the matched sets contained within them.}
\usage{
\method{summary}{matched.set}(object, ..., verbose = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a \code{matched.set} object}

\item{...}{Optional additional arguments to be passed to the summary function}

\item{verbose}{Logical option specifying whether or not a longer, more verbose summary should be calculated and returned. Default is 
\code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
list object with either 5 or 1 element(s), depending on whether or not \code{verbose} is set to \code{TRUE} or not.
\item{overview}{A data.frame object containing information about the treated units, and the number of matched control units of weights zero and above.}
\item{set.size.summary}{a summary object summarizing the min/max and IQR of matched set sizes}
\item{number.of.treated.units}{The number of units that are considered "treated" units}
\item{num.units.empty.set}{The number of treated units that were not able to be matched to any control units}
\item{lag}{The size of the lag window used for matching on treatment history. This affects which treated and control units are matched}
}
\description{
A summary method for viewing summary data about the sizes of matched sets and metadata about how they were created. This method
accepts all standard \code{summary} arguments.
