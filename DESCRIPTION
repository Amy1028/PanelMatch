Description: This R package provides a set of methodological tools
	     that enable researchers to apply matching methods to
	     time-series cross-section data. Imai, Kim, and Wang
	     (2018) proposes a nonparametric generalization of
	     difference-in-differences estimator, which does not rely
	     on the linearity assumption as often done in
	     practice. Researchers first select a method of matching
	     each treated observation from a given unit in a
	     particular time period with control observations from
	     other units in the same time period that have a similar
	     treatment and covariate history. These methods include
	     standard matching methods based on propensity score and
	     Mahalanobis distance as well as weighting methods such as
	     synthetic controls. Once matching is done, both
	     short-term and long-term average treatment effects for
	     the treated can be estimated with standard errors. The
	     package also offers a visualization technique that allows
	     researchers to assess the quality of matches by examining
	     the resulting covariate balance.
